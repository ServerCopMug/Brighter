# Brighter
This mod will make your client-side lights much brighter. Keep in mind different vehicles can have different brightness settings. Below I have included some possible reasons why you don't get the same results as I do.

 **If you don't experience the same results try these:**

* Make your PostFX settings higher

* Try a different vehicle to see if it's a vehicle model issue on your server

* Try a different server. Sometimes servers can have visual packs installed or other resources that will mess with yours. 

<h3>Rules</h3>

1. NEVER EVER EVER re-upload scripts without permission.
2. Always give credit. 

<h3>How to install</h3>

1. Download the latest file and extract it
2. In your windows search bar below type `%localappdata%` and press enter.
3. Navigate to your `FiveM` folder and open it. 
4. Follow this path: `FiveM.app\citizen\common\data` 
5. Drag and drop the `visualsettings.dat` file into the folder, if you have to replace a file that is fine.
